Task Planner System

Design and implement a task planner system

A task has the following details :
Title
Creator
Assignee (Optional)
Status
Type
Due date

A task can be of following types with additional information apart from what is mentioned above
Feature
Feature summary
Impact (Low, Moderate, High)
Bug
Severity (P0, P1 or P2)
Story
Story Summary
A story can have multiple SubTracks
A SubTrack has the following details :
Title
Status
A subtrack can be created and attached only to an existing story in non-completed status


It should be easy to add a new task type to your application

The status can change from a state to any state.
Status field takes one of the following states depending on the task type :
Feature => Open, In progress, Testing, Deployed
Bug => Open, In progress, Fixed
Story => Open, In Progress, Completed

Subtrack status field takes one of these values
Open, In Progress, Completed


A sprint is defined as a collection of tasks used to track progress. You can add or remove a task from sprints.
A task can be part of only one sprint at a time.










Your task planner should have the following functionalities:
Task
Create a task of any type
Create subtrack
Change the status of the task/subtrack
Change assignee of the task
Display tasks assigned to a user categorised by task type
Sprint
Create/Delete a Sprint
Add/remove task to/from sprint
Display sprint snapshot. This should display the tasks that are part of the sprint and also display if they are delayed or on track
Bonus Question (Only if time permits) :-
The transition/change in the status should be based on allowed transitions
eg :-
For task type feature, we might want to have only following allowed transitions :
Open => In progress
In progress => Testing
Testing => Deployed
In progress  => Deployed































The examples below are just to understand the functionalities and may not necessarily be used in the same format as input to your driver program.

Let’s say we want to add the following tasks to a sprint :

Tasks:

Title
Creator
Assignee
Status
Due date
Type
Type attributes (comma separated)

Subtrack:

Display tasks assigned to a user categorised by task type:

Eg: For assignee Ryan
User => Ryan:
Task Type => Bug
Title => Fix mysql issue
Sprint =>  Sprint-1

Task Type => Feature
Title => Setup console
Sprint =>

Title => Console api
Sprint =>

Task Type => Story
Title => Create a microservice
Sprint => Sprint-1
SubTrack:

Eg: For assignee Peter
User => Peter:
Task Type => Feature:
Title => Create Dashboard
Sprint => Sprint Id/Sprint name


Display status of Sprint-1

Sprint title => Sprint-1
On track Tasks:
Fix mysql issue
Setup console
Create Dashboard

Delayed Tasks:
Create a microservice


Note: Task will come under “delayed task” if  the task (with non-completed status) has crossed the due date






Expectations :
Please make use of in memory data structures and do not use any external datastore for
storage/querying.
Input/Output can be from terminal or file or taken from some data structure inside the driver program whichever is convenient for you. It should be easy for the evaluator to give new input or change existing input and test new cases.
You can look for API references online.
Demoable code. Functionalities mentioned above  
Clean Interface design for the module.
Clean internal design and implementation of the library and the application.
Functional completeness is a must. Bonus questions are good to have.
Extensibility
Take care of Exception and Corner case handling.
Test cases covering various cases are good to have.
You are free to use the language of your choice.
